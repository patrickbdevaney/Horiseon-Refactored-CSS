# Horiseon-Refactored-CSS
An html page for Horiseon, a company providing social media marketing, reputation management, and search engine optimization. The user story indicates that the company wants semantic tags to identify the strcuture of the page for search engines and alt attributes on images so that the website is more accessible to screen readers. The html code has been improved with semantic tags for search indexing, and alt attributes describe each picture for accessibility. The linked CSS page has been consolidated so that fewer selectors affect more elements which use the same style. When applicable, style attributes affecting the same element are removed from extra classes and condensed into one class.
