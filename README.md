# Horiseon-Refactored-CSS
An html page for Horiseon, a company providing social media marketing, reputation management, and search engine optimization. The html code has been improved with semantic tags for search indexing, and alt attributes describe each picture for accessibility. The linked CSS page has been consolidated so that fewer selectors affect more elements which use the same style. When applicable, style attributes affecting the same element are removed from extra classes and condensed into one class.
